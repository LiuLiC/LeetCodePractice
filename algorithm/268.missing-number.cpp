 * Total Submissions: 516.7K
 * Testcase Example:  '[3,0,1]'
 *
 * Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n,
 * find the one that is missing from the array.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [3,0,1]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
 * Output: 8
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
 * it using only constant extra space complexity?
